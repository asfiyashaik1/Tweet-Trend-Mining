Quantity to Quality. #NEP2020 1. Increased focus on foundational literacy and numeracy. 2. Competency based learning 3. Students will be learning how to learn bringing in metacognition 4. Curriculum content reduced to core essentials 5. Emphasis on constructivist
5+3+3+4 structure will definitely bring a paradigm shift! This was much needed. This shirt video explains it well. I think we need more of this to create the awareness. Good one by @HRDMinistry #educationpolicy2020 #NEP2020 
2020 finally moving forward! #Rafale #NEP2020 #RamMandirAyodhya 2020 will remain a historic year not just for #COVID19 but also for the reforms for civilization &amp; #India. Thank you PM @narendramodi ji &amp; all the citizens for your relentless pursuit to revolution.
"It is entirely silent on the question of Kashmiri students whose education is being jeopardized by years of curfew, erratic school closures and general life being traumatized with draconian laws. is education not for kashmiri students? #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
Why some people are opposing the new National Education Policy and #RejectNEP2020 is Trending? Govt : This is the reason we r changing our education policy. #NEP2020
Sir please publish SSC CGL Tier 3 result.Its been 7 mnths since we appeared for the exam.Even #upsc mains was conducted 15 days after it and final result got published http://today.As admirer of #NEP2020 I hope u will look into this incessant delay from SSC @narendramodi
#NewEducationPolicy #NEP2020 which encourages students to work in latest technologies including Spiritual studies like Yoga &amp; Meditation along with NCC &amp; an education system that promote #AtmaNirbharBharat .
"And these changes point at diverging the economic gap in our nation rather than bridge it, some of it is welcome but most of it is a clear act of discrimination. #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020 #educationpolicy #education"
The national education policy draft includes no mention of Jammu and Kashmir or any of the North eastern states or how special provisions will be made to include these areas where conflict persists. #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020
How is the government aiming to fulfil this digital divide with only proposed 1.86 percent budget increase? What companies have been contacted to fund or subsidise the costs for laptops and mobile phones or tablets and internet connection? #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020
"As far as access to education is concerned, only 10 percent of government schools in India have access to computers. Only an abysmal 4 percent of total have internet connectivity. #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020"
"In a country where fluency in English is considered a top indicator of merit and subs. as a filter for economic opportunities, students who arent well versed in English wl be robbed of opportunities to escape brutal despondency created by caste and class discrimnation #NEP2020"
"Conveniently this implies that the only students having to incorporate such massive changes in instruction are students from Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi students whose future is being jeopardized. #NEP2020"
Which predominantly leaves this change to be incorporated by state schools and government schools where the students from marginalized sections and minorities study. #NEP2020
Govt officials have stated that KVs and CBSE schools will not have to incorporate medium of teaching in regional languages as these schools cater to students whose parents are central gov employees with frequent transfer and jump in instruction will be difficult 4 them #NEP2020
The maximum brunt of such de-allocation has been previously borne by social science departments that catered to research on topics such as women’s studies and caste. No detail about the increase in budget with proper allocation and disbursal scheme has been mentioned. #NEP2020
"The gov apparently intends to increase spending on education to 6 % of GDP when under current Modi regime, the edu budget has been reduced from a minimal 4.14% to 3.2% with deductions in scholarships for higher education as well as budget allocations to research dept. #NEP2020"
Why are we not asking the questions of the hour that what is this policy really pointing at. Saffronism in the patronage of this policy #NEP2020 @fayedsouza @msisodia @ShashiTharoor
"#NEP2020 New Curricular and pedagogical structure A new developmentally-appropriate curriculum and pedagogical structure for school education based on principles of brain development and learning has been proposed on a 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 design, covering 4 stages."
The #NEP2020 is the next big thing that would change the nation. I'm feeling jealous.
"And let's think about it, B R Ambedkar wouldn't have made his mark if he never got to learn English and that language gave him the edge that has him (someone who the entire society looked upon as an outcast) be the Father of our Constitution #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020"
"Keep debating what suits your propaganda madam. Anything related to Sanatan Dharm is regressive and oppressive too for likes of you. However, when this doesn't work, you people chose the Dalit way of attacking Sanatan Dharm indirectly. Keep it up. But, that won't work #NEP2020"
4. You bring in vocational education which is the better term for we will give you a degree in subjects that you can accrue minimal labour from and hence with no English they're just going to be going back 10 year of improvement #NEP2020 @TimesNow @republic
2. Giving state wise control again shifting the demographic and giving it scope of creating political issues 3. You are removing a language which has helped bring uniformity #NEP2020 #NEP
Dear So called #Hindi Fanatics and #Sanskrit extremist.... Kindly Teach Hindi to the people of Uttarpradesh and Bihar… before you trying to impose it on Non Hindi states in the name of #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP #புதிய_கல்வி_கொள்கை
Then provide with teachers of these subjects in all government schools then i will support #NEP2020
"The NPE 2020 is power pack strategy for making India a Global leader. I am BHARAT & can speak- Hindi, English and Bhojpuri; yes it's my choice Hope it will be implemented in all possible manners so can reach every corner of BHARAT @DrRPNishank #NEP2020 #NewIndia"
#NEP2020 It should be just fine. 
"#NEP2020 New Education Policy 2020, a detailed analysis for #Students of India. A major #positivechange for the students studying in school &amp; college both. What's in this for you, watch full video on NEP2020 &amp; share this video! https://youtu.be/rHYlD4bqZZI #youthaajkal #NEP2020"
"So many 3rd students have started doing their Masters courses in India and haven't even finished bachelors yet, thanks to the joke @Delhiuniversit has made of our lives. Just give us our degrees already. You are ruining your image. #StudentLivesMatter #cancelallexams #NEP2020"
NEP2020 instead conveniently found a technocratic solution to feed more disposable workers to industries. How does incentivizing the student to undergo vocational training help making students stay back in school to finish education and enter higher edu institutions? #NEP2020
"The policy has not tackled the reason for dropouts, which wasn’t travelling the world or taking gap years but sheer economic despondency forcing students into informal labour. #NEP2020"
"On page 11, the policy states –“ In particular students would continue to have the option of exiting after Grade 10 and re-entering in the next phase to pursue vocational or any other courses available in Grades 11- 12, incl at a more specialized school, if so desired.” #NEP2020"
The emphasis on vocational training with multiple exit options is nothing but a material assertion of the caste system. Can dropout rates even be curtailed if the government is incentivizing dropouts by providing multiple exit options? #NEP2020
Students from upper caste can rely on network and social capital to attain opportunities even if they are not meritorious in board exams. The solution to this isn’t a superficial consolation in words but increase in economic opportunities and employment. #NEP2020
"In response to shrinking economic opportunities, cut throat competition arises which becomes an additional burden for students from marginalzied communities who also have to face the brunt of caste and class discrimination. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"Shrinking of emphasis on board exams aims to relieve exam pressure but misses entire reasons for this stress on students from marginalized communities. Unemployment in India is at a record 23.5% as of July 2020,recruitment in public sector reducing low. #NEP2020"
"Neither is there a systemic critique of the caste systems’ involvement with education and its persistent presence within the education sector, nor is there any allocation of funds to decrease inequities in caste. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"In the sixty six page document the word caste is mentioned only six times, most of which are cursory mentions. The policy uses declining caste based representation in education as a burden on the government’s developing nation agenda. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"These enrollment drop offs are more severe for Scheduled Tribes students (10.6% to 6.8%), and differently-abled children (1.1% to 0.25%), with even greater declines for female students within each of these categories”- NEP 2020, pg. 25. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"According to U-DISE 2016-17 data, about 19.6% of students belong to Scheduled Castes at the primary level, but this fraction falls to 17.3% at the higher secondary level. #NationalEducationPolicy #NEP2020"
"NEP 2020 intends to redesign pedagogical structure and promote creative thinking. Despite its assumed objective, policy seems to have lost connection with ground realities of education, indulging rather in deceptive progressive politics. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
NCC should be mandatory in all school -> For Discipline Life Inclusion of Traffic rules and Road Discipline in Syllabus -> For Safe Life Inclusion of Disaster Mgnt with Practical Exercises -> For Safety & Precaution #NEP2020 #NewEducationPolicy2020 @HRDMinistry @DrRPNishank

"#SDG4 #equitable #NEP2020 universal access to high quality ECCE across India. Priority to socio-economically disadvantaged locations. Anganwadis, Ashramshalas being brought in the purview. Large-scale advocacy."
Students of arts and humanities will aim to learn more science and all (institutions including engineering institutes) will make an effort to incorporate more vocational subjects and soft skills. One of the many lines I liked in the new education policy. #NEP2020
#NationalEducationPolicy #NEP2020 can be game changer if implemented properly with adequate checks. Need for fixed accountability from teachers to school necessary at every stage. loopholes in accountability sld be removed with regular reviews every 2 years from feedback.
Our Play2Learn Program aligns with the #NEP2020 that lays emphasis on play-based learning as a crucial part of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE). Our Play Sessions are designed to support children’s academics and build their holistic development.

"Is #NEP2020 reflective of the rural-urban divide? NEP has included 'coding' as one of the skills it wants to inculcate in students. My niece who just entered middle school is vying to do a course herself. So, NEP is somewhat reflective of the nextgen's aspiration."

The States get nearly half their revenues of over ₹30 lakh crore from SGST (20 per cent) and Central tax transfers (27 per cent) (@RBI). Both of which are expected to affect due to COVID-19. Not that situation of center-state finances was better before the pandemic hit. #NEP2020
Yes! State govts also spend on education as a concurrent subject but their revenue streams are limited after GST was introduced. @nipfp_org_in analysis shows almost all states in India are already underspending on education. Who will fund #NEP2020 ? 
The above numbers are just about financial commitments needed annually to fulfill outcomes related to RTE/ Free elementary education. We have to also consider funds for: Secondary education Higher education Vocational courses #NEP2020
So let's make 10 languages compulsory in all schools #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP With so much advancements in Artificial Intelligence the language barrier is no at all an issue. Understand NEP is not just for 2020 it is for next 20-30 yrs. (1/2)

"Before thrusting #NEP2020 on kids, let all the BJP MPs and MLAs take tests in Sanskrit, Hindi and English, including the sinister architect Kasturirangan and share their marks out in the open. I am sure they won't even score the minimum marks to make it to the cut. #TNRejectsNEP"

The #NEP2020 does not mandate Hindi (the draft last year seemed to). Tamil Nadu should embrace it and work with other states to strengthen state languages by teaching them in one another's schools. But that would require a forward-thinking government.

TN rejects three language system. Now next serious problem is All India Entrance exam for all higher education. Because having different syllabus in each part of India each student will be studying different ones. And common exam is simply unjust to those students. #NEP2020

The #NationalEducationPolicy2020 must be studied as a cumulation of several different factors and not just as the document itself. Here is the first part of our 2-part newsletter that explores the factors that influenced the #NEP2020: 
Analyse Before Criticizing ! THE National Education Policy is far better than its predecessor. So just don't go on Criticizing it without knowing the facts. https://www.mhrd.gov.in/nep-new Also a video by @abhiandniyu https://www.instagram.com/tv/CDZRiXoJLAk/?igshid=1ievvjxkqqx0o #NEP2020 #NewEducationPolicy #SupportNEP

4 main changes in our education system : 1. Internship during schooling. 2. Primary education in local language. 3. Higher education of Indian universities in foreign countries. 4. Multiple exit options. #NationalEducationPolicy #NEP2020 (https://youtu.be/Y5TACP4av4M) @abhiandniyu
"@PMOIndia @HRDMinistry Thanks for the much needed reform #NEP2020. Kindly make sure 2 things: 1. Existing teachers to be trained &amp; tested else retirement 2. Like Army, no reservation policy. If not possible, bring min cut off rule for qualification."
#NEP2020 The policy took inspiration from the world’s top education policies. The team which turned it into reality is also highly educated and well accomplished. I don’t think we should pay heed to the opinions of those who have done phD in mating patterns of African monkeys!
"Sir! The #NEP2020 will reduce the gap between poor and rich! 6% of this trillion-dollar economy will be invested in education! If you don't know, let me tell the NEP 2020 will extend the Right to Education to age group of 3-18 from 6-14!"

#NEP2020 Old guard touch of NEP 2020 is 3 languages and mother tongue till class 5 or 8. Between all the good changes in the bill they tend to bring-in their old school thoughts .. hopeless
"Nothing elite about it! Single language medium is the only way to uplift poor kids on par with the elite. We are taking education back to the 19th century with state-language mediums; Centre/state govts should stop imposing #NEP2020, leave choice of education to parents/kids."
#NEP2020 Generally speaking apart from language parameters the NEP 2020 can be tested without much hesitation.. but the Language parameters will be really a pulling down factor for this policy and will definitely yield failure. Education in English a mandate for global job

The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in the Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest as per #NEP2020.
Now education is no more single approach. It is multifaceted! High-quality education with a wide range of subject option to choose #NEP2020 will surely make our country emerge as very advanced &amp; powerful.

"Assessment reforms by #NEP2020 with 360-degree Holistic Progress Card, tracking Student Progress for achieving Learning Outcomes."
Hope central govt will implement #NEP2020 at the earliest.
Also this #NEP2020 will take tamil to other states too. So this is helping tamil to grow. This will help tamil grow more than what dravidia politicians did for tamil growth. Equal importance is given for all classical languages. also no language is imposed on anyone.
"Small dare to all dumilans and politicians who are saying that #NEP2020 will destroy tamil, kindly show me if all schools are made to teach tamil mandatory? But this NEP will make tamil mandatory in all schools. There are many in TN who has passed schools without Tamil iself"
To all ppl stating false info abt #NEP2020 kindly show me where any language is made as mandatory apart from mother tongue . The new policy seems to be more practical oriented and will improve the quality of our students.

Sir.. i really appreciate #NEP2020. 5+3+3+4 is not new. On government schools it will start from anganwadi. Private schools already have nursery onwards. Government must review syllabus &amp; enforce proper governance to ma ke sure the education is nor a burden. In fact it can b fun

#NewEducationPolicy #NEP2020 which encourages students to work in latest technologies including Spiritual studies like Yoga &amp; Meditation along with NCC &amp; an education system that promote #AtmaNirbharBharat .
"And these changes point at diverging the economic gap in our nation rather than bridge it, some of it is welcome but most of it is a clear act of discrimination. #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020 #educationpolicy #education"
The national education policy draft includes no mention of Jammu and Kashmir or any of the North eastern states or how special provisions will be made to include these areas where conflict persists. #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020
How is the government aiming to fulfil this digital divide with only proposed 1.86 percent budget increase? What companies have been contacted to fund or subsidise the costs for laptops and mobile phones or tablets and internet connection? #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020
"As far as access to education is concerned, only 10 percent of government schools in India have access to computers. Only an abysmal 4 percent of total have internet connectivity. #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020"
"In a country where fluency in English is considered a top indicator of merit and subs. as a filter for economic opportunities, students who arent well versed in English wl be robbed of opportunities to escape brutal despondency created by caste and class discrimnation #NEP2020"
"Conveniently this implies that the only students having to incorporate such massive changes in instruction are students from Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi students whose future is being jeopardized. #NEP2020"
Which predominantly leaves this change to be incorporated by state schools and government schools where the students from marginalized sections and minorities study. #NEP2020
Govt officials have stated that KVs and CBSE schools will not have to incorporate medium of teaching in regional languages as these schools cater to students whose parents are central gov employees with frequent transfer and jump in instruction will be difficult 4 them #NEP2020
The maximum brunt of such de-allocation has been previously borne by social science departments that catered to research on topics such as women’s studies and caste. No detail about the increase in budget with proper allocation and disbursal scheme has been mentioned. #NEP2020
"The gov apparently intends to increase spending on education to 6 % of GDP when under current Modi regime, the edu budget has been reduced from a minimal 4.14% to 3.2% with deductions in scholarships for higher education as well as budget allocations to research dept. #NEP2020"

"#NEP2020 New Curricular and pedagogical structure A new developmentally-appropriate curriculum and pedagogical structure for school education based on principles of brain development and learning has been proposed on a 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 design, covering 4 stages."

NEP2020 instead conveniently found a technocratic solution to feed more disposable workers to industries. How does incentivizing the student to undergo vocational training help making students stay back in school to finish education and enter higher edu institutions? #NEP2020
"The policy has not tackled the reason for dropouts, which wasn’t travelling the world or taking gap years but sheer economic despondency forcing students into informal labour. #NEP2020"
"On page 11, the policy states –“ In particular students would continue to have the option of exiting after Grade 10 and re-entering in the next phase to pursue vocational or any other courses available in Grades 11- 12, incl at a more specialized school, if so desired.” #NEP2020"
The emphasis on vocational training with multiple exit options is nothing but a material assertion of the caste system. Can dropout rates even be curtailed if the government is incentivizing dropouts by providing multiple exit options? #NEP2020
Students from upper caste can rely on network and social capital to attain opportunities even if they are not meritorious in board exams. The solution to this isn’t a superficial consolation in words but increase in economic opportunities and employment. #NEP2020
"In response to shrinking economic opportunities, cut throat competition arises which becomes an additional burden for students from marginalzied communities who also have to face the brunt of caste and class discrimination. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"Shrinking of emphasis on board exams aims to relieve exam pressure but misses entire reasons for this stress on students from marginalized communities. Unemployment in India is at a record 23.5% as of July 2020,recruitment in public sector reducing low. #NEP2020"
"Neither is there a systemic critique of the caste systems’ involvement with education and its persistent presence within the education sector, nor is there any allocation of funds to decrease inequities in caste. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"In the sixty six page document the word caste is mentioned only six times, most of which are cursory mentions. The policy uses declining caste based representation in education as a burden on the government’s developing nation agenda. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"These enrollment drop offs are more severe for Scheduled Tribes students (10.6% to 6.8%), and differently-abled children (1.1% to 0.25%), with even greater declines for female students within each of these categories”- NEP 2020, pg. 25. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"
"According to U-DISE 2016-17 data, about 19.6% of students belong to Scheduled Castes at the primary level, but this fraction falls to 17.3% at the higher secondary level. #NationalEducationPolicy #NEP2020"
"NEP 2020 intends to redesign pedagogical structure and promote creative thinking. Despite its assumed objective, policy seems to have lost connection with ground realities of education, indulging rather in deceptive progressive politics. #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020"

"We demand utmost inclusive education where young minds can get their hands on all inclusive and holistic aspects. Which doesn't glorify only one particular religion,trandition,culture,agenda -(i.e, SAFFRONIZATION). @narendramodi @PMOIndia #NEP2020"
What a blatant lie! We dont want #NEP2020 to be implemented as saffronise education. @narendramodi @PMOIndia
Thankyou sir @rtn_sandeep @DeepakDwivedi_ #NEP2020 #Sdgchoupal

A4. #NEP2020 #SDGs are already working in several languages of the world. Both local Languages and #SDGs support each other. सतत विकास लक्ष्य 2020
We need to set small-small task instead of setting a Big goal. #SDGs #NEP2020
My take on the #NEP2020 
Expecting particular native people to learn your language just because you are one hell of a lazy shit bag to learn theirs instead is whole another level of bullshit.. #NEP2020 #NEPisBrahmanism #TNAgainstNEP
Thanks for adding good points to everyone’s thoughts @SportandiAndres @rtn_sandeep @DeepakDwivedi_ #NEP2020 #SDGCHOUPAL
"Sir, #Rafale, #NEP2020,#RamMandir won't erase the pain &amp; Stigma of Economic Hardship, unemployment, inflations, 3% interest rate, Gold &amp; oil price, Migrant labors, False Test Kit, PM care, Chinese Intrusions, MLA buying &amp; 2nd spot in COVID episodes even after 500 years!"
Thankyou for your encouraging words @chetna @rtn_sandeep @DeepakDwivedi_ #NEP2020 #SDGCHOUPAL
This is the future of #NEP2020. Why go abroad when you have great colleges in India itself? 
"OPINION | Merit, not inclusion. ‘Holistic’ instead of ‘liberal’. Shallow eclecticism rather than criticality: #NEP2020 is full of pious keywords that mask a violent lurch back towards hierarchy and unfreedoms, writes @anuarunima1. #NationalEducationPolicy"

"If we talk about quality of education, then #NEP2020 is best designed for. But question always comes about implementation and also by whom it is being implemented."
"The #NEP2020 has prioritized #OnlineEducation for the upcoming future of India! So did the government frgt that Kashmir is a part of india too? Because, since last 1 year there is neither 4G nor 3G network available. How will they be able to stand by with the other states?"
Modi needs to fix this fake Mughal glorification through #NEP2020

2 points against the #NEP2020's Language Policy: - Past studies have shown earning returns from fluency in English to be as high as 34% - Will this lead to Hindi being forced upon non-Hindi speaking students? For more points read:

"This is #NEP2020. JNU VC @mamidala90 has secured ₹455.02 crore of HEFA ""funding""! This is not a grant (which doesn't need to be repaid), but a loan which will be repaid by increasing students' fees. Who will be able to get higher education with such hefty fees? #RejectNEP2020"

3 language policy is stupid. #bjp is the one giving it political spin. Junk this nonsense suggestion. Because Simply don't put additional burden on children for a fruitless exercise. Children have more important things to learn. #pmmodi #NEP2020 #nep #india
Agreed! #NEP2020 #SDGCHOUPAL @DeepakDwivedi_ @rtn_sandeep
it is important to recognize the role of language in general and mother tongue or local languages in particular in the drive towards sustainable development goals. We argue for a language-based approach towards the SDGs in ensuring their success. #NEP2020 @sdgchoupal @EdChatIND
I second that! #Nep2020 #sdgchoupal @rtn_sandeep @DeepakDwivedi_
Global to glocal New education system with #NEP2020 hv to be chalked out and accepted #SDGChoupal @rtn_sandeep
"The New Education Policy was launched on Wednesday, July 29, 2020. The Union Cabinet approved the policy that aims to overhaul the country’s education system. Opinion | Dr. Asad Sahir | #NEP2020 https://youtu.be/OdNOhy6Dmu8 via @YouTube Opinions are personal."
"We usually say that our mother tongue has that emotions which is sometimes not possible with any other language, the same way, local languages will be celebrated upon. When you are happy, you will learn more and adapt quickly. #NEP2020 #sdgchoupal"
"A4: #NEP2020 I take it as upliftment of disadvantaged groups such as disables, OBC, tribal communities, economically weaker section etc. Bringing them to the mainstream, enabling Ss to learn&amp; comprehend better for strong foundation. @sdgchoupal @SDG4QEducation @SDGsForChildren"
"It will ease bridging gap in studies. Drop out rates will be lesser, more kids will be educated, sooner we will have better literacy rates across country instead of just a few selected states. Most states will enjoy reading in their own way. #NEP2020 #sdgchoupal"
Giving new dimensions to the school complexes/clusters on multiple fronts by 2030. #NEP2020 #TransformingIndia
Q4. How will local language medium of instruction support SDGs ? @RitaSingh0210 @ashokkp @akmittals @AboutImpact @Chetna1806 @drvijaay @Kapoor_Divya_ @kirtidakale @sodhisumedha @IamCJha @ReemaMallik @AbhilashaTochi #NEP2020 #SDGCHOUPAL @dp_2211 @DeepakDwivedi_ @rtn_sandeep
People are saying”ab itna education system change kr hi diya hai to prom night bhi add kar dete....” I just wanna ask “tumhare saath aayega kaun?” #NEP2020
And with the #NEP2020 it will become more of a hoi polloi fauj.. much like Zia's Pakistan... No wonder CDS has welcomed the projected impact of the NEP on our military.. It will become an official version of the RSS Shakha 
"As we are strong after the pandemic, we will adapt to make the best of #NEP2020 too. #sdgchoupal"
"A3: #NEP2020 tremendous opportunities educators as it addresses d quality of teaching by improving teachers training. For me, A lot more learning ,more freedom&amp; time to explore best practices, with reduced content from quantity to quality.@IprmGrp @sdgchoupal"
It will give me a wide range of experiments to make along with the kids though this happens today too but syllabus transformation as per #NEP2020 will make it more relevant and convenient. Experiments always give us various opportunities to learn. #sdgchoupal
"//Credit system and many other salient features of #NEP2020 , vv impressed with this explaination // I totally respect you being impressed with HER explanation of #NEP2020. I couldn't wait to see the TRUE outcome of this #NEP2020... "
A3: The best of #nep2020 is a curriculum that is skill based. It will bridge the gaps and bring a new perspective to the future jobs. #NEP2020 #sdgchoupal
"@narendramodi @PMOIndia @nsitharaman I'm seeing against #NEP2020 may trend like #Jallikattu It is upto you, to sense it or not. It is very serious issue. Plz withdraw NEP 2020, as early as possible."

This will help us maintain the quality education. Quantity maybe lesser but the same has to be ensured to be the best one being learnt within and outside the classroom. Internships will give them more exposure to the world. #NEP2020 #sdgchoupal @Shalini040876 @dp_2211

Its broad vision is to Upskilling kids instead of letting them cram and move ahead. Emowering youth and making kids curious to learn new things by exploring them themselves. Teachers will be treated as a facilitators instead of just instructors. #NEP2020 #sdgchaupal
Respected @DrRPNishank sir This “3E”framework at village level will help in defining the problem with solutions which definitely may be the best way in making the policies/programs with detail feedback &amp; study. Thanks #NEP2020 #NationalEducationPolicy2020 #education

When people of TN migrate to other states; knowing only Tamil and English won't be sufficient. Learning other regional languages will help you survive. It's 2020 and TN parties are still insecure over North Indian languages like Hindi. #TNStudentsWantsNEP #NEP2020 #TNSupportNEP
"Learning the unlearned. In a system of memorisation and textbook knowledge, we’re going to change it one step at a time. #educationpolicy2020 #NEP2020 #AcademicTwitter #blendedlearning"

"Instead of a third language, life skills like karate, swimming could be useful for the kids #NEP2020 #No_to_hindi"
Provinding a training to children doesn't make them child labour instead it teaches the values of those things. If you think it makes labour then you should clear your mind #AcceptNEP2020 #NEP2020

Exactly. They'll feel the real crunch when people realise the advantages of implementing #NEP2020 #TNWelcomesNEP20
In most public policies there is are gaps between intention and implementation. Hope the #NEP2020 is implemented well and as promised. State governments will require to customize NEP to their requirements. Delhi Govt experience in Education may find more takers.
It is indeed an honour to present the #NationalEducationPolicy to the Hon'ble President of India. His ideas enunciated during the last year's Governor's conference became part of the policy. #NEP2020 @rashtrapatibhvn

You full mental. Look before you leap. Go and read #NEP2020. Nowhere forced. It's your wish to choose any language listed. 
Earlier education policy aim was at making a #soundcareer .This #NEP2020 seems to have aimed at developing #soundmind . Thanks to Govt of India for radical reforms. @DrRPNishank @ABVPVoice @abvpuoh @ABVPOsmania @BJP4India @BjpAchary @ABVPTelanagana

The US State Department has welcomed the #NEP2020’s decision to allow the setting up of top foreign universities in India while adding that it is looking forward to greater cooperation between American and Indian universities. 
End to end speech translation will make it possible to translate in live with ur own voice and modulation.. Instead of 3rd language the students should learn new skills and develop abilities to solve practical world problems of the humanity #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP (2/2)
"Overall, when it comes to the financial side of #NEP2020 , the numbers just don't add up (At least for school education). Hopefully, govt will announce a concrete financial roadmap to rationalize the targets set by the policy. #NewEducationPolicy2020"
The States get nearly half their revenues of over ₹30 lakh crore from SGST (20 per cent) and Central tax transfers (27 per cent) (@RBI). Both of which are expected to affect due to COVID-19. Not that situation of center-state finances was better before the pandemic hit. #NEP2020
Yes! State govts also spend on education as a concurrent subject but their revenue streams are limited after GST was introduced. @nipfp_org_in analysis shows almost all states in India are already underspending on education. Who will fund #NEP2020 ? 
The above numbers are just about financial commitments needed annually to fulfill outcomes related to RTE/ Free elementary education. We have to also consider funds for: Secondary education Higher education Vocational courses #NEP2020
So let's make 10 languages compulsory in all schools #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP With so much advancements in Artificial Intelligence the language barrier is no at all an issue. Understand NEP is not just for 2020 it is for next 20-30 yrs. (1/2)
#NEP2020 introduces features with an aim to achieve 100% Gross Enrollment Ratio in preschool to primary by 2030. #TransformingIndia
"The states need additional Rs. 9.82 lakh crore annually for free elementary school education alone. This is massive. To put this number into perspective, the central govt's entire education budget is around Rs. 99,000 crores (ten times lesser) #NEP2020 https://www.oxfamindia.org/press-release/new-education-policy-2020"
Thread Many things have been written & said about #NationalEducationPolicy 2020 but no one is asking one basic question 'How we will fund this?' India’s current education budget cannot fund the #NEP2020 unless govt gives additional funding. (At least for school education)

But sorry to say I don't agree with you on #NEP2020 REGARDING its language policy.
I am not saying that #NEP2020 is completely perfect according to me anything in this world can not be 100% perfect. I agree with @msisodia sir saying that the government of India should make a law regarding central government and state governments should compulsory

#NEP2020 glorifies #CriticalThinking and states that students shd become #CriticalThinkers. Good. The irony is that the govt doesn't want academics or anyone to raise critical thinking questns. Anyone who raises questns about #Ayodhya and #RamTemple is labelled an anti-national.
"Before thrusting #NEP2020 on kids, let all the BJP MPs and MLAs take tests in Sanskrit, Hindi and English, including the sinister architect Kasturirangan and share their marks out in the open. I am sure they won't even score the minimum marks to make it to the cut. #TNRejectsNEP"

The #NEP2020 does not mandate Hindi (the draft last year seemed to). Tamil Nadu should embrace it and work with other states to strengthen state languages by teaching them in one another's schools. But that would require a forward-thinking government. 
"#NEP2020 #TNWelcomesNEP I know: Tamizh, Samskrita, Hindi, English, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, German. Learning Urdu. Languages, both sign &amp; verbal, are beyond religion, region, ethnicity, et al. State shd facilitate learning, not control. Right to Education is sacrosanct."

We don't know all that. This is Hindi imposition even if the 3 langauge idea is left to state government. #Modi down down. #NEP2020 
3 language policy is outright stupid and pointless. Should be junked. 2 languages is best fit - English + Native Don't put additional circular burden on students this way. They will learn another language by interest when time comes. #india #NEP2020 #bjp #nep #pmmodi
"India currently needs #labourers &amp; #workers , not #highlyeducated people, she has only #servicesector no #manufacturing ; this will give India her #workers. #educationpolicy2020 #NEP2020"
The funny part of #NEP2020 is it feels that just by bringing in a structure from the western countries they can transform education system here. That is such a wrong idea. Unless we bring in change on a qualitative basis its a total failure. #RejectNEP

"~ A PM without any higher educational qualifications, who isn't aware of basic (A+B)^2 formula - is now initiating #NewEducationPolicy. It'll help BJP to make people fool and more illogical in future. So that they can spread RSS/BJP propaganda among the next generation #NEP2020 "
#NEP2020 talks a lot about experiential learning. It is about individuals being able to express themselves while they learn. For this to happen the teachers need to be good listeners. In that respect our institutions of higher learning have lot to transform.

@narendramodi you made it A very healthy step taken for education system #NEP2020
I think they should started this policy earlier then we will be benefited for now. @HRDMinistry @ugc_india (5/5) #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020
If this happens then it will be awesome. But the policy is nice & they should also include this . I loved the #NEP2020 #educationpolicy2020 this policy takes India to the next level. (4/5)
or doing degree in mechanical & taking a side course such as coding then they should get the credits of it. So they have two skill Developed one is mechanical & other is coding so it will be a nice beautiful thing happen i think gov should add This also in the #NEP2020. (3/5)
if that happens then it will be awesome & they should also get a certificate of diploma & degree too (2/5)#educationpolicy2020 #NEP2020

I don't understand why @HRDMinistry has to give states an option to amend the #NEP2020. @CMOTamilNadu said he's not happy with the 3 language scheme due to political pressure which means they might oppose legally. The whole purpose of the policy would be lost if not implemented

#NEP2020 Also very little about medical education in the new NEP. Aren't medical students a part of higher ed? Shouldn't they have multidisciplinary ed? Isn't there a chronic shortage of doctors + medical research in India? A pandemic is a perfect time to reform medical ed.

The same #DMK which opposed #English as a medium of instruction in #TamilNadu government schools are now against #NativeLanguage education saying it should be english . Ena design da neenga ? #DmkFails . #NEP2020 #TNRejectsNEP From the records :
"Without the active involvement of the private sector, this #NEP2020 is not going to be moving forward. "
people who not supporting New education policy are either they haven't read it or they don't want to see a self reliant develop india. It's a revolutionary education policy.I fully support it. #NEPForBharat #NewEducationPolicy2020 #NEP2020
"#NEP2020 is the best educatnl reform that has ever happnd in modern India.. Stupid ppl are gonna REJECT everythng..wen govt aks them to breathe air, r they gonna reject that too??"

"Comment | The #NEP has several innovative ideas and daring proposals, but also makes a few problematic assumptions #NEP2020 "
"#NEP2020 too supports privatization of institutions. Kapil sibbal introduced CCE system in schools. I asked CBSE why? They told to minimize the burden. Now when BJP came, CCE removed. I asked CBSE why? Answer was it was creating problems in class 11 as they have to read all."

"No point in having discrimination discussions on English Medium for #NEP2020. English schools, especially predatory missionary schools degrade language and make it seem profane. Such deranged individuals only treat obscene bollywood expressions as a fetish, and promote it. "

Anybody can learn any language by their own wish....Ther is no barrier for learning but it should not be compulsory & additional burden Spending additional time to learn third language will really reduce the attention over the technical and other scientific studies #NEP2020
Thank you very much @abhiandniyu You guys always come up with very factfull videos and really appreciate your efforts. As so much negativity is going around in media after NEP so I thought below video would be the best example to clear ur doubts #NEP2020 
"2. #Sanskrit is ""one"" of the classical languages. Is it wrong to expect #NEP2020 to be provide equal emphasis on other classical langs?If center provides more funds to state govt to promote sanskrit,will state appoint saskrit teachers/other lang teachers? "

#NEP2020 In a Nutshell My take on it!!

#NEP2020 Old guard touch of NEP 2020 is 3 languages and mother tongue till class 5 or 8. Between all the good changes in the bill they tend to bring-in their old school thoughts .. hopeless
"Nothing elite about it! Single language medium is the only way to uplift poor kids on par with the elite. We are taking education back to the 19th century with state-language mediums; Centre/state govts should stop imposing #NEP2020, leave choice of education to parents/kids."
#NEP2020 Generally speaking apart from language parameters the NEP 2020 can be tested without much hesitation.. but the Language parameters will be really a pulling down factor for this policy and will definitely yield failure. Education in English a mandate for global job

creativity in every field rather than focusing on language barriers or language division #NEP2020 #mhrd #UGCGuidelines #finalyearexams
It is a known fact that learning in mother tongue is the best as rightly reiterated in #NEP2020. We must #promoteourlanguages to create a #NewIndia while Re-imagining Indian Universities. @ugc_india @HRDMinistry @DrRPNishank @atulkotharissun @AICTE_INDIA

Genuinely confused about this. Is it a technical language/framing issue in the way India's New Education policy has been drafted? The 3-language model allows students to adopt ANY two languages that are native to India. How is Hindi being imposed? #NEP2020 
Was lovely to hear from people I admire deeply for their work in the field of education has been pioneering. My contribution was about sports integration and how excited I am to see it featuring prominently in the #NEP2020. Implementation will be key! 
Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji and Education Minister Shri @DrRPNishank ji. I appreciate all your efforts for framing #NEP2020 for skill India and quality Edu. Fee structure of Sainik Schools across our country especially for civilian students is little high though

"request @PrakashJavdekar @ncert to make 3rd language as an exam free subject, so that people just learn it and it does not become a burden for students. Another idea is to make the entire third language as option for students and encourage it by giving additional marks #NEP2020"

"I am not talking about #NEP2020. I have my reservations on Kanimozhi,but at the same time have seen the same in other airports.Time CISF sensitized the same to all staff to know english/local language whichever is applicable. Men on mission but need to be sensitive and sensible."

"But when and where, who is imposing hindi. Please read #NEP2020, this is more optional depending upon the State Governments."
Pathetic to see how few people have found something new to devide us. Though #NEP2020 has made that know students will have education till 5 th class in their mother tongue. How can somebody even think of it that North is trying to impose their language.

Last tims you went on writing poems and this time you are busy with #NEP2020 just cause you wanna dodge this issue as well but we will not stop !!!!! #NTAPOSTPONEJEE_NEET
@DrRPNishank pay attention to what youth wants! Stop strategizing #NEP2020 And look into the matter of students. Its pathetic how you're into these political issues but not into the real issue. #NTAPOSTPONEJEE_NEET
excellent narration...i like this version ..hoping to see the good and bad changes in history #NEP2020 
What a Spin..! Lies..Thy name is #DMK ..! TN welcomes #NEP2020 
"What gaps does #NEP2020 seek to address? “Oxford is designing a #COVID19 vaccine. Indian institutions,when they have really exerted themselves, came up with a sanitiser. We’re not even producing good, employable graduates:” @DineshSinghEDU in an interview:"
"#NEP2020 will not do any magic when Govt. does not have the intention to correct what is wrong today, don't show this false dream of tomorrow when today Govt officials, UGC are not doing their duty effectively @DrRPNishank @narendramodi @ArnabGoswamiRTV @RajatSharmaLive"
"1 major source of disappointment in #NEP2020 is the lack of encouragement &amp; recognition given to homeschooling. In this light, it is difficult to envisage a revival of traditional systems &amp; sources of learning. Too much statism? @TIinExile"
"#NEP2020 50% people of Tamilnadu speak eitherTelugu, Kannada or Malayalam at home. NEP will help these children learn their mother tongue.South Indian children in North Indian states too get a chance to learn their mother tongue."
Teach kids to create #chatbots to create fake likes on #SocialMedia to earn lakhs should be part of the vocational education that schools should start #teaching teaching. Algebra can't even rhyme in a #rap song. #mimitweets #vocationaleducation #NEP2020
But Their experts are busy writing opinions in leading dailys about India's #NEP2020 . Excerpt from #DawnNews
I am unable to understand that What's your problem with Hindi? #NEP2020 says that children should learn in their mother tongue till 5th Class and/or further possible. There is no so-called #HindiImposition on anyone. You are only doing Politics over language.

What's the benefit of implying #NEP2020 when student's mental health doesn't matter to you? Why are uh risking our life just for an exm. This exm is impt for us bt not more than our health. #NTAPOSTPONEJEE_NEET @DrRPNishank @narendramodi @PMOIndia @DG_NTA @anubha1812 @HRDMinistry
"Tbh all the students, people are putting in their valuable time and efforts to make the good decisions and still the @DrRPNishank is addressing #NEP2020 and isn't even acknowledging a single thing. I guess we're kind of wasting our time in this. #NTAPOSTPONEJEE_NEET @DG_NTA"
I support this arguement . We should fight for #serveinmylanguage . But Please take legal action instead of tweeting . Every central government staff posted in TN should know tamil. Raise this in parliament. Tweeting as this is happening only now is nothing but politics #NEP2020
Bharat had biggest universities when When Europe was in internecine medieval warfare amongst abhrahomic religions.... Unfortunately our Liberal & peaceful culture invited vultures. Peace can only be insured by Srength... Let knowledge get us strength. #NEP2020 Tamso Maa Jyoti.. 
Mr @DrRPNishank how many times in a day do you tweet about this #NEP2020. Have some concern about students and please postpone NEET &amp; JEE #NTAPOSTPONEJEE_NEET
#OPINION | Can a young student decide for him/herself what vocation to opt for? Is this lot going to be drawn from slow learners or those belonging to poor families who know their parents can’t afford higher education for them? @PushpeshPant on #NEP2020.

Sir You are yet to clarify the questions of many people like me on the actions taken about telling true history of India to students under #NEP2020 ... It will go a long way if you give assurance in this regard
"Person: So what do you study? Me: Thermal Science, doing PhD Person: What after PhD? Me: want to do rese.. Person: Did u know, the new #NEP2020 gives u a research degree if u complete 4 yrs of undergrad. What will happen to u nw? Will u get any job? *Indian context* (Frnds ) "
Do you think #NEP2020 is a revolution to the current Education system ? #AskKTR @KTRTRS
#NEP2020 must think about what to glorify and what to not. Emphasis also should be given on mentioning what was good and what was not for Indian Culture. Just telling events wont fulfill the purpose of education. CC: @ncert @TIinExile

One thing is true #NEP2020 changes are bold and mandatory steps in Our Education system.Yes still govt lags for not including sex and financial kind of important education from early age. But sometimes we should appreciate few steps despite disagreement with other govt policies.
After seeing the details of #NEP2020 #binod be like Binod need no education.
#Parents partipatation in the Decision making Process of #Schools if incorporated in #NEP2020 would Surely make #AffordableEducation a Ground Reality! We @ParentsGurgaon would request @narendramodi Ji! To make #Parents Partipatation a Important part of #NEP2020 !
@RajivMessage I agree.. this #NEP2020 is the biggest failure of the @narendramodi government till now. Tomorrow's India is the new America for leftists. These days education is a joke. These Institutions gonna be the new drugs centre.

"Agree :). Language is v, v complicated in India, also the issue of “mother tongue” as you said. My point is we must teach language well, but we don’t. And #NEP2020 has nothing in it to ensure that. Breaking down language into grammar, MCQs robs it of all joy and beauty."

#NEP2020 recommends that every child should attain foundational literacy and numeracy by Grade 3. The National Achievement Survey 2017 found that only 57% could do basic arithmetic and 68% could read and understand small texts. 
"#NEP2020 aims to increase the GER in higher education to 50% by 2035. As of 2018-19, the GER in higher education in the country stood at 26.3%. The table below shows the trend of GER in higher education over the last few years. "
Major reason for dropping out of school was engagement in domestic activities for girls and in economic activities for boys. #NEP2020 recommends strengthening current schemes aimed at disadvantaged groups and setting up special education zones and a gender inclusion fund. 
#NEP2020 noted that retaining children in school is a challenge despite near-universal enrolment at primary level. Gross Enrolment Ratio (enrolment as a % of the population of the corresponding age group) was 99.2% at primary level vs. 56.2% at senior secondary level in 2015-16. 
"#NEP2020 Free boarding facilities will be built in school locations where students may have to come from far, and particularly for students who from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with suitable arrangements for the safety of all children, especially girls. "

The decision of including coding from 6th std is very praiseworthy! But I just hope that schools don't ask students to write that code on paper as a part of assignment (as colleges do) because if that happens then students will start to hate coding by 8-9th std. #NEP2020

Retrograde mindset of the political parties in Tamilnadu- the ruling dispensation as well as the opposition parties. The Dravidian parties opposing 3 language formula will be denying and betraying the interests of school children of the state towards progress #NEP2020
What’s the big problem for political parties in Tamilnad to oppose 3 language formula in #NEP2020? School kids will get window of opportunity to learn one more language. 2 language formula is a retrograde policy detrimental to the best interests of school children of the state.
