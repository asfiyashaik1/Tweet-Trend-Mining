"The story of #TheHowsOfUs is well sewn. The flashbacks are well done. At times the film is predictable but even that, perhaps, is a device to further bring to the fore the many Hows and Whys of love, of life, of living—even dying. #TheHowsOfUsUnliThankYou"

"#ScrapUniversalCredit 

I could give you a list of reasons why. But I wont.

"In my early years 
I hid my tears
Passing my days alone
Adrift in an ocean 
Of loneliness
My dreams lived on
To catch the love
Found in books
And films and songs
In a world of illusion
In the place where
The real world belonged
Still i look for their beauty
To lead me
Further on"

"#Oceans8 
5 years, 8 months, 12 days and counting; that’s how long  Debbie Ocean has been devising the biggest heist of her life. She knows that it’s going to take a team of the best people in their respective fields. Their target, a necklace that’s worth more than $150 million. "
lol this is so amusing #oceans8 
i'm watching oceans8 tonight!!!
@rihanna in #oceans8 omg!!!!     she’s gorgeous!
How is it that #Oceans8 was almost 2 hours long and it still felt under-developed? I feel like too much of it was left to secondhand accounts by the characters and not enough of it was told in real time or as we watched.

Just Finished watching #Oceans8. Stupid and Boring as Fuck.
"Finally saw #Oceans8 and although I was pumped to see it and seriously rooting for it, it definitely disappointed. Great cast but the storyline was unimaginative and unintelligent. I was hoping for some #AtomicBlonde level genius. #PainfulToSay"

"**Future** 

#Oceans8 and #Oceans franchise Saga 

There will be an Ocean 8,9,10 

With an all women cast. 

Then 11 and 12 will be the mixed cast. (The men and ladies.)

Last, 12, will be the heist that lands Danny in prison just before losing his marriage. #Prediction"
The new #oceans8 was such a big gay mood for me
"To all the men out there who didn’t enjoy #Oceans8 and are still talking about it, that is fine. They didn’t make it for you. They made it for us, and that’s ok. It’s a chick flick. You don’t have to like it. You got 3 other movies with the exact same concept, enjoy those."
#Oceans8 shied away from it but there was definitely something there between Debbie and Lou...I didn't imagine it. It was real and it was palpable.

I want to watch #Oceans8 again just to build my outfits like Lou...

"#Oceans8 hauled in $41.5 million, which is the highest opening weekend of any ‘Ocean’s movie yet

#Oceans8 (★★★★☆) knows just what to do with Anne Hathaway's often under-tapped comedy skills. She is SUPERB alongside a wonderful cast and the film itself is a glitzy blast. My review for @TimeOutNewYork:
"Anne Hathaway is so damn good in #Oceans8, and I'm so glad she's getting so much credit for it. But guess what guys? Anne Hathaway is always good! In, like, everything!

"Probably the biggest thing, and a major reason that CRAZY RICH ASIANS isn't that exciting to me, is that HK Cinema (at the time) featured every genre imaginable so I didn't have to be satisfied with just one romcom featuring Asians. I had endless movies to choose from."
not just saying this cause she's my BLOOD relative but @amandamyeo's article on #CrazyRichAsians is the one i will be linking to any time someone implies that we don't need diversity.
K I’m just gonna say it @CrazyRichMovie is a perfect movie. Don’t @ me. I will be going to see it multiple times for the mahjong scene alone. Oh and the wedding when @ConstanceWu whispers ‘I love you’ yeah I’m still ugly crying...

"Also, you could do a double feature of Crazy Rich Asians and Searching this weekend in theaters. That. Is. Amazing."
Matt going on about Crazy Rich Asians and telling everyone to stay for the mid-credit scene makes me  #SaveShadowhunters
"“What was the last thing? Oh yeah, uh go watch Crazy Rich Asians”  #SaveShadowhunters"
"you know those people who are overly critical about every single movie that isn't a French indie film?? Like ""how dare you enjoy the greatest showman that was crap"" or ""Crazy Rich Asians?? Ew so hyped"" and ""to all the boys i've loved before is rom com trash"""

Read the amazing story behind Rachel Chu’s engagement ring in #CrazyRichAsians! @bustle
I can’t reiterate enough just how important it is to go see #CrazyRichAsians in theatres. A lot of our Mulan cast & friends went to a NZ screening to rep - this movie only had a 4% box office drop on its second Friday! Let’s continue the momentum and show Hollywood what’s real. 
After watching Crazy Rich Asians I had to invest my time into a Mah Jong set! Gonna learn and body everyone who thinks they nice 
"I'm not happy that Searching didn't get the number of theater openings that Crazy Rich Asians got. I want to live in a society where AsAm can have a variety of accessible AsAm movies. This is important to diversity. There's actually a lot of diversity, but few mainstream support."
What a time to be alive where an all Asian cast in a mainstream studio Hollywood film becomes #1 at the box office for THREE weekends in a row. #CrazyRichAsians #GoldOpen #RepresentationMatters #DiversityIsStrength
"I very deeply felt the Nico Santos character, cousin Oliver Tsien, in the Crazy Rich Asians movie - a queer Asian son finding ways to make himself useful to his family. It was kind of a throwaway line, but that was one that hit me deep in the queer diaspora Asian feelings."
"I finished line edits on my debut MG fantasy THE DRAGON WARRIOR & drafted book 2! Now I’m revising a YA social thriller that’s ONE OF US IS LYING x CRAZY RICH ASIANS, & plotting a Chinese diaspora heist story about literally taking back culture from the west #AsAmCreatorRollcall"
it's not just hype @crazyrichmovie was adorable and beautifully shot GO SEE IT 
"When @awkwafina's character, Goh Peik Lin, opens the trunk of her car to pick an outfit when they roll up to the party.  #CrazyRichAsians"

We feel so much chemistry between the two. Charlie and Astrid. I hope to see the film as quickly as possible. Because I feel that I will really love it. #CrazyRichAsians #HarryShumJr. I really want to see the movie.
"Before #CrazyRichAsians's Constance Wu and Henry Golding there was the 1937 crime film 'Daughter of Shanghai.' Starring Anna May Wong and Philip Ahn, it was the rare (still rare) Hollywood film with two Asian American actors in lead roles. "
It's cool if she hated it and it's fine if some people don't like #CrazyRichAsians but why do we have to move on? It's a significant movie for Asian Americans and the continued box office success makes it still a relevant topic.

5 ways the 'Crazy Rich Asians' movie is different from the book 
"Watched @CrazyRichMovie tonight with the hubby. It was very entertaining. Even my hubby, who was skeptical at first bcoz he thought it was a girlie movie, enjoyed himself. 

And @krisaquino214's role may have been short but it was memorable. "
'Crazy Rich Asians' depicts only a slice of life in Singapore — and it does a huge injustice to the actual people who live there — via @ForeignPolicy
"In “Crazy Rich Asians,” Kris Aquino plays some Malay royalty named Princess Intan. 

In “Feng Shui,” Kris plays Joy, whose cheating husband is Inton.

Wala lang."

"'Crazy Rich Asians' looking at a stunning $25M second weekend, outpacing the likes of 'The Help,' 'The Proposal' and 'Bridesmaids.' #CrazyRichAsians #boxoffice"
Ludicrous $$$$$. CRAZY RICH ASIANS packed away another $7M on Friday and will likely hit $25M this weekend—nearly identical to its opening weekend. That’s some crazy sh!t right there.
the wedding scene from crazy rich asians is prolly one of the most beautiful wedding scenes i’ve ever seen in a movie
"BOX OFFICE: #CrazyRichAsians is looking to almost match its opening weekend w/ $25M, which is rare. The smallest drop between 1st & 2nd weekends currently belongs to M:I GHOST PROTOCOL, which dipped just 0.5% ($29.5 to 29.4M) between its first two weeks in over 2500 theaters "

Ppl hating on #CrazyRichAsians saying they can’t “relate” to Crazy Rich Asians and saying it sets unrealistic expectations - did y’all watch Black Panther and couldn’t relate also hence it was a bad movie? Are you a royalty of Wakanda?? Didn’t think so.

I bet they don't have a scene where a guy is snorting cocaine off his iPhone X with a $100 bill"
"Remember: Netflix so badly wanted to make Crazy Rich Asians they offered a SHIT TON of money, apparently a jaw dropping amount, WAY MORE than Hollywood was willing to risk before Kevin Kwan and Jon M Chu turned it down because they wanted to put Asians in cinemas."
"This, the new rom com with Randall Park and Ali Wong, To All The Boys I’ve Loved, AND they tried to fund Crazy Rich Asians. NETFLIX has done more for Asian representation in the past few years than Hollywood ever bothered.

"Going to see a movie today, for the first time since Rex was born!  What did I choose?  @CrazyRichMovie   I LOVE that there is more inclusion in Hollywood, even though it is slow going!  I LOVE seeing diversity and strong, bad a$$ actors that aren’t cliche!"
#CrazyRichAsians was absolutely amazing! Glad my love for @HarryShumJr brought me here. I had to travel 1 1/2 hours because sadly there was only one cinema in my country showing the movie but it was totally worth it. Already looking forward to the sequel! 
I’ve never seen people stay so long after a movie besides a Marvel movie. Crazy Rich Asians is something else.

"So, @colintrevorrow opened #JurassicWorld with a shot of an egg/eggs hatching in a lab. What if he was to open JW3 with a shot of eggs hatching in the wild in North America, and humans stumbling upon them?

I think that'd be pretty cool. "
"Finally wrote up some thoughts on #JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom and how its fairy tale apporach to dinosaurs, adulthood and childhood makes it the most natural successor to #JurassicPark yet:

"#FallenKingdom stomped into North American theaters Thursday night, earning a promising $15.3 million in previews. As expected, that's behind the $18.5 million preview gross for #JurassicWorld in summer 2015 "
'@JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom' Delivers $15.3M from Thursday Previews https://imdb.to/2MJodIq 
"For sake of comparison, #JurassicWorld made $18.5 million on its first Thursday night in 2015. Looks like Fallen Kingdom is gonna be another monster hit. "
"#JurassicWorldFallenKingdom debuts in US to $15.3M in THU pre-shows, down 17% vs #JurassicWorld from JUN 2015. About even with #SpiderManHomecoming but beats #ThorRagnarok by 6%. Might reach low 50s for full opening day #boxoffice."

 #JurassicWorld Round 2 
.@JurassicWorld: #FallenKingdom opens in theaters tomorrow – Before watching the latest installment in the franchise take a look back at each trailer:
Saw #FallenKingdom tonight. Different from the previous 4 and sets up some interesting ethical questions and debates for the next one. I hope they don’t shy away from it. Love that #JurassicWorld/Park movies are entertainment that also makes you think. @colintrevorrow
"R.S.V.Pre-historic!! It’s ok if you missed the party tonight at @UniStudios, because @FOXLA has all the @JurassicWorld highlights at 10pm!   – at Universal CityWalk"

Just Because this was one of my most popular vines back in the day #JurassicWorld 
The final dinosaur I’m looking forward to seeing in @JurassicWorld_ is the #Stygimoloch or juvenile #Pachycephalosaurus. I was surprised that the film franchise decided to include a dinosaur with a rather dubious existence. Still I’m looking forward to seeing this dino.
Congratulations to @FilmBayona @m_giacchino @LeDoctor @Maniella @JusticetheSmith @BryceDHoward @prattprattpratt @colintrevorrow @JurassicWorld and everyone else involved in the project on the US release! What a fun film!

.@JurassicWorld: Fallen Kingdom achieves the distinction of being the first film from the franchise in which you want to slap the dinosaurs as well. 
The makers of ‘@JurassicWorld: Fallen Kingdom’ would have been less insulting if they lined up fans of the franchise and slapped them one by one. Horrifically bad film at every single level. Avoid at all costs. 
The new #JurassicWorld movie rocks. It owes more to Mary Shelly than Michael Crichton. As much Nosferatu and Frankenstein. Bravo J.A. Bayona for changing it up. Spoiler: the dinos aren’t the bad guys.
So I’m the biggest JP fan & care so much about these movies. @JurassicWorld is up there with the original. Perfect story & so different to the others. Darker. @FilmBayona has served up a perfect JP flick & it made me miss my dog so much.

Just watched @JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom and I wanna thank @FilmBayona & @colintrevorrow 4 creating a wonderful masterpiece. You put @JurassicWorld on a new level. It has been a unforgattable moment to see it on the big screen. Can't wait to see the epic conclusion
"#JurassicWorld: Fallen Kingdom is a hell of a ride, but is it worth watching? Here's our spoiler-free review: http://bit.ly/2LqLJbM "
" | 6th of June is gonna be a big one. I had the pleasure of seeing this with the fam and it's insanely awesome. Takes Jurassic Park action to a new level and @FilmBayona such a cool new twist to the franchise. @prattprattpratt is awesome as always. Congrats dude #JurassicWorld"" "
I wonder if people who complain about feathered dinosaurs or claim dinosaurs doesn't/can't look scary with feathers realise that they are *exactly* this kid #JurassicWorld #JurassicPark
"For me, #JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom captures onscreen perfectly what it means to be obsessed with dinosaurs."
"#JurassicWorld is a fantastic return to the franchise and an awesome soft reboot that gets everything correct: a great new cast, awesome dinosaurs, terrific action and set pieces and a rather original if a bit controversial story. A great cinema experience! #JurassicPark"
"For some critics, #FallenKingdom is simply a sign that the #JurassicWorld series has, like the dinosaurs it features, lived past its sell-by date "
"Epic weekend: When you and @Amazon unveil a @JurassicWorld T-Rex, and @prattprattpratt and @BryceDHoward show up to help out."
"#JurassicWorld fans: This time around, @BryceDHoward's Claire will leave the high heels in the office and wear sturdy knee-boots when it's time to run through the jungle"
"Best movie we have seen in ages!!!  Go see it everyone,  @Universal_Irl have out done themselves this time, it's out tomorrow!!  #FallenKingdom #JurassicWorldFallenKingdom #JurassicWorld "
Our #JurassicWorld: #FallenKingdom review has broken free. Read it here: https://www.empireonline.com/movies/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom/review/ …
"Review soon-ish, but I would give your left arm for a #JurassicWorld movie centered around @BD_Wong's brilliant and oddly principled mad scientist. Watching Dr. Wu discuss his relative ethics is as engrossing as any dino chase."
Wow. #JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom is a movie for true dinosaur believers. They did it y’all.

I’m rewatching Mission Impossible 2 for the first time since it first came out and it’s comically bad. There’s a sequence where one character walks toward another in slow motion that goes on for like 7 minutes. I’m 40 minutes into the movie and basically nothing has happened yet.

When Mossad meets KGB meets CIA meets RAW meets MI6. 
"Wth! Virginia’s state Senator Richard Black met w Assad and then went on Arab TV saying that MI6 is planning a chemical attack in Syria. 

How much is Putin paying him? And better yet who elected him?  "
"Jeremy #Corbyn received ""a short intelligence briefing"" on the latest Salisbury developments, according to his spokesman.

"#AmericanAnimals may go down as my most underrated movie of 2018. This movie is awesome. The four stars bring it and the fact that it’s based on a true story, IN LEXINGTON, is crazy. I love how they mix the documentary style with fictional elements. It is so much fun. GO SEE IT."
Carole and I just left the movie “American Animals” Bart Layton has done it again. What an exciting story. It will take your breath away.
Happy #IndependenceDay! Celebrate by getting out to see these 10 iconic American animals:

Incredibles 2 cracked over 1 billion dollars globally  I feel special that I contributed watching the early release  #Incredibles2 
"Watched #Incredibles2 with my kid.  The idea that one spouse must sacrifice carrier for the other, both spouses can’t have a meaningful carrier if they have kids, a man is a bumbling idiot if he takes care of the children - are misguided.  This is not an empowerment movie."

#Incredibles2 opened good in India on day 1 with 4 cr nett range. It is good opening considering it is animation film . Infact it is better than #Race3 collections yesterday. Today it will have very good jump because multiplex will see very good growth.
"#Race3 Saw the lowest Total on its 2nd Friday - ₹ 3.25 Cr... New releases like #Incredibles2 and #Hereditary have affected its business.

So now its sad to note that some Distributors who have bought film for high prices will not be able to recover even half of their investment."

And like, for a ""kid's movie""? That's AWESOME. "
"What I'll add: Jack-Jack is the real MVP of this film.

#Incredibles2 "
I am SUPER  excited to be part of #Incredibles2. Incredibles was one of my absolute all-time fav animated films EVER and after watching “2” tonight I am floating on air. My dreams! My dreams are real life!!!

I noticed this immediately as well. #Incredibles2 was amazing but the strobe lights are intense and go on for a full minute+. Be aware if you or your kids have issues with flashing lights or #Epilepsy. Great film and worth seeing!

here’s some quality content of gianna and i bopping out to mamma mia this morning

"If you’re going out to the movies this weekend. And you decide to watch MaMa Mia.
Just remember you’re supporting people in that movie who condone child sex rape and torture.

You were warned!"
"When I'm working at a coffee shop, I'm in a constant state of worry that everyone can hear my earbuds blasting the ""Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again"" soundtrack and yet I'm telling the world here..."

hey folks I sat down with @CNNRcGLDN and co to talk abt the hollywood blockbuster film “The Meg” and how much worse it is than Mamma Mia and Crank 2. give it a listen: 
Kisses of Fire/The Day Before You Came/I Wonder (Departure) are the most underrated mamma mia 2 songs but they are SO good!! alexa and jessica’s vocals in kisses of fire shshsjsk
Mamma Mia! but every single role is played by Colin Firth
"If you're in San Diego, I'm the faggot in a Mamma Mia! shirt who just ordered a $12 bottle of champagne at some sort of heterosexual college country establishment."
we were watching mamma mia and raph was singing along he's very cute 
just watched mamma mia: here we go again with my mother and when the movie ends she looks me in the eye and asks “is barbra streisand dead?”
"ONE MORE HUGE THING: The PER-SCREEN AVERAGE of #CrazyRichAsians has only dropped by 8%—from $2148 to $1985...while it added about 150 more screens. Again Mamma Mia, CRA’s nearest comp, dropped 68%—from $4307 to $1362. Yes, by 2nd weekend Mamma Mia had a lower per-screen than CRA."
"when dennis goes to nd to be w/ mandy, he finds out she slept with 2 other men around the same time she slept with him and got in contact with all of them to figure out who was brian jr.’s dad. he steps outside and is suddenly in greece. everybody’s singing abba. it’s mamma mia."
What @RahulGandhi does not say is that his Mamamia gave same Reliance owned Pipavav Port contracts to build Naval Vessels. Using Raul's Chutiya logic how can a port operator build Naval Vessels then?
"Right, opera people, my credibility is on the line here. On a day of heavy Mistral I accompanied Mrs V to a showing of Mamma Mia 2 and, well, I ran out of hankies. Sorry."
But why isn’t Goin’ Band doing a Mamma Mia show? :(

"Had a great time doing @TheTakeaway with @amyewalter and @jwpetersNYT. We discussed mamma Mia 2, mostly "
"the BIGGEST plot hole in mamma mia! here we go again is that sam calls bill his best friend even though they never interact in either movie so my explanation to that is that, actually, harry is bill's best friend but they never told sam that because he has no friends"
"Guys—this is blowing my mind and should do the same for Hollywood (and anyone who loved #CrazyRichAsians). CRA projects at $7M in box office yesterday. It made $7.3M LAST Friday in its opening.

That’s a drop of just 3.7%.

By comparison, Mamma Mia dropped 67% 1st to 2nd Friday. "
Literally the first thing I thought of when I saw these pants was Mamma Mia I’m actually ABBA trash you guys 
"Hey Will, how’s your day been? 

Well, I’ve just been Dad dancing and singing Mamma Mia on stage in the fanzone with @svandoorne. So there’s that."
new hobby: watching mamma mia hwga just to see how many people cry
they really need to keep making mamma mia movies until they run out of abba songs. i would love to hear the cast sing some of abba’s more underrated bops
Honestly this is all I wanted from Mamma Mia 2

The reason why Cher and Meryl didn’t get to sing a song together in Mamma Mia! hwga is because when they are on screen together for too long they go to another level of greatness which isn’t human anymore...

Things I've learned upon seeing Mamma Mia 2: 

1. Everytime they mentioned that Donna was dead I cried, which makes me worried as to how I'll react when Meryl Streep actually dies. 

2. Dancing Queen makes me cry with HAPPINESS. 

3. I cry a lot when ABBA is involved."

I wonder if all the people who were stuck in traffic on the freeway with me enjoyed my full concert to the Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again soundtrack.

"I’m pretty sure that ABBA is a group of time travelers who came to the present, saw Mamma Mia, and decided to go back in time and record all of the songs as their own"

"My little one, my new baby. This tattoo represents me so well. Mamma Mia is one of my favorite musical, and now that i'm starting my musical school, it's very significant. I hope i'll be as perseverant as Donna was. Now a little part of my skin is hers. "
mamma mia cinematic universe is THAT powerful huh 
the version of super trouper at the end of mamma mia 2 absolutely did not have to go that hard
really don’t ride in a car with me unless you want to sing-a-long to the mamma mia 2 soundtrack at the top of your lungs
Finally about to see Mamma Mia 2 with my main squeeze and you BET I’m sitting outside making sandwiches to sneak inside with me 
Keep thinking about how shit Mamma Mia would be if it wasn't a musical. Like a woman who owns a hotel and has 3 men who are willing to act like fathers to her child because she doesn't know which one is the real father? Weird. Add ABBA to it? Masterpiece.

Nobody talks about Bill and Harry’s introductions into Mamma Mia 2 but they are truly iconic. Harry fast asleep in a meeting in Japan then storming outta there and Bill getting his brother to accept his Swedish award for him because their girl needed them
